This constituency covers 7 out of 10 Vidhan Sabha constituencies of Vadodara district and first held elections in 1957 as Baroda Lok Sabha constituency in erstwhile Bombay State (present day Gujarat).[1] It has been known as Vadodara since the 2009 elections. Its first member of parliament (MP) was Fatehsinghrao Gaekwad of the Indian National Congress (INC) who was also re-elected in the next elections in 1962. He was the Maharaja of Baroda of the Gaekwad dynasty at the time.[2] P. C. Patel of the Swatantra Party won the election in 1967. From 1971\u201380, Gaekwad was MP of this constituency again firstly as a member of the Indian National Congress (Organisation) and then as a member of the INC. His younger brother, Ranjitsinh Pratapsinh Gaekwad also of the INC represented the constituency from 1980\u201389 for two terms before being defeated by Prakash Brahmbhatt of the Janata Dal party in the 1989 election.[3]\n",

Yeddyurappa resigned.[4] He therefore had to resign as MP for this seat which forced a by-election in 2012.[5] This by-election was won by K. Jayaprakash Hegde of the Indian National Congress (INC). As of the latest elections in 2019, Shobha Karandlaje of the BJP represents this constituency.\n",
